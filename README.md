# About the Project

  We need a name for the app! Anyway, here's the problem. I use tSheets everyday to track my time for work, and it's great, except it doesn't keep a running total of the hours each week for each job. So I find myself Friday afternoon spending half and hour adding up all the time I worked on each project. Now we have [Project Name Here]! 
  
  It's intended for freelancers just trying to track the time they spend on each project. The app will track their time, track time spent on each project for the week, month, all time. The user can enter how many hours they want to work for the week, and it'll track how much time they have left in each day and the estimated time in which they can be done each day. This will be a smart function that will adjust the end time if the user works more one day than the other. It'll track their overall working time for the day, week, month. And any other features that pop up that are cool (see future ideas at the bottom)
  
  The actual application is built on Electron (Slack, VSCode, Atom, Postman (I think) is built with it), and the server files are built with Typescript. Because the application is freestanding, I split the project into two repositories, GUI and Server. In the future we can host the server and have the GUI downloaded via Github releases. Each repository has it's own github issues to tackle and will help to keep the two parts separate. 
  
  I had a little trouble getting jQuery working with Electron (I didn't get it working; it didn't happen), so I thought it would be great to build an app all in vanilla javascript. With that said, the app uses components built with classes (similar to React) and DOM manipulation is done with "event handlers" that I wrote. As more is built, the js_Library will grow! 

Below will be how to set the app up, build in it, work with github, and future ideas I have.
